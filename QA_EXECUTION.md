# QA Execution Documentation — portfolio

## Scope
Repository/source inspection, dependency/build configuration, existing tests and CI, functional/negative scenarios, security-sensitive configuration, and deployment configuration where applicable.

## Execution matrix
| Area | Expected result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Source integrity | No unexplained broken references | Repository inspection |
| Build | Build succeeds when executable | Build/CI logs where available |
| Tests | Existing tests pass | Test/CI evidence where available |
| Functional paths | Core flows behave as designed | Tests/source/runtime evidence |
| Negative paths | Invalid input is handled safely | Tests/source evidence |
| Security | No confirmed secret exposure | Configuration/source review |
| Deployment | Configuration is coherent | Workflow/deployment review |

## Defect classification
Confirmed defects require reproducible failure or direct source/CI evidence. Missing/incomplete implementation is documented as a limitation, not invented as a defect.

## Status
**QA execution documentation completed.** Runtime claims are made only where execution evidence exists.

## Limitations
Additional runtime testing depends on the repository's available executable code, dependencies, environment variables, and test infrastructure.
